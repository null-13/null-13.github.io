                <p dir="ltr"><span>OF DESIRES AND THEIR ORIGIN</span></p>
                <br>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Desire, who moves the world: what are her many names? She is want; she is will; she is lust; she is attraction; she is all approaches towards all objects; she is that towards which all tends. She is the calling of all names, and all names in their calling. Without her, there would be only separation, and not even the <i>recognition</i> of separation, as cognition is itself a <i>putting-together</i>. She is the mother of all particular desires, who wears their multiplicity as masks. We live only by her grace&mdash;without her we would not even want to <i>breathe</i>. Yet some still forget her, mistaking her masks for her face, and making idols of them.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Some are lead by this idolatry to think that some wants have a separate origin from others&mdash;a higher source and a lower source, for example&mdash;and that their specific origin reveals their desirability</span><span>.</span><span> They think like this: the &ldquo;higher&rdquo; kind of desire is to be praised and cultivated, while the &ldquo;lower&rdquo; kind is to be detested and denied. They think, said another way: &ldquo;I must want to want </span><span>this</span><span>, and I must </span><span>not</span><span> want to want </span><span>that</span><span>.&rdquo; This is a confusion, for in truth all that is born of desire is good. Their error is in attempting a <i>dissection</i> of desire, in order to isolate and extract a <i>cause</i>, in hopes of attaining power over all things.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>To dispel this confusion, consider hunger. A child may think it comes from the stomach, because this is where it is felt&mdash;and so, that the stomach must be its origin. We know that hunger is truly felt in the mind, and that this feeling is attended by changes in the brain, in the hormones, in the gastric fluids. We know also that this feeling coincides with a certain configuration of the body. But if we said that hunger therefore has its origin in the body, the mind, or the body-mind, we would repeat the previous mistake. Instead we must look to the aforementioned <i>certain configuration</i>.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>The body attains any given configuration through the combined influence of the entire environment, with countless and varied configurations corresponding with any nameable desire. These many configurations are brought about by the total configuration of all things, and not by the state of any singular organ or number of organs. To say that hunger has its origin in any number of configurations is to posit again the plural origin of desires, when in truth all desires coincide with the configuration of all things at once&mdash;an encompassing which precludes the isolation of desires, or of particular origins, or of causes. This is why we say: &ldquo;hunger has no cause apart from thirst; thirst has no cause apart from hunger.&rdquo;</span></p>
